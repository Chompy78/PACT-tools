# PACT — Roadmap

> Written for agentic assistants (VS Code Copilot & Claude Code). With `AGENTS.md` committed, you don't
> repeat project context — **paste one task at a time**, review the diff, accept. Each task ends with a
> **Done when** check.
>
> **Rules for this file** (see `AGENTS.md`):
> 1. Holds only **open / planned** work. When a task is DONE, **move it into `CHANGELOG.md`** in the same change.
> 2. **Single writer.** Agents: *output* new items in this format for the human to fold in — don't append directly.
> 3. One task per branch. The open git branch is the "in flight" signal.
>
> **`REV-NN` items** come from the 2026-06-29 code review. Full evidence, code, and acceptance criteria
> live in **`docs/PACT-Code-Review-2026-06-29.md`** — commit that file alongside this roadmap so the
> pointers resolve. Findings are filed by severity: HIGH → Now, MEDIUM → Next, LOW → Later.

Completed work (PWA shell, auth, cloud sync, campaigns, hardening, landing-page redesign, PHB data) has
landed and graduated to `CHANGELOG.md`. Review findings **REV-08** (docs drift) and **REV-09** (scratch
file) will be closed by the **still-pending CU-1 / CU-3** tasks below — not done yet.

# 🔴 NOW — high-severity fixes + cleanup

> **Quick win first:** CU-1 and CU-2 are ready-to-commit files — knock those out immediately. The HIGH
> fixes (REV-01…04) are the priority work in this bucket.

## REV-01 — Make the regression gate actually assert (HIGH) — TODO
The gate is hollow: the runner hard-codes `pass: true` and `expected-results.csv` columns are all blank,
so it only proves `compute()` *doesn't throw*. **Do this before trusting any "5/0" below.**
```
1. Capture current known-good outputs into testing/expected/expected-results.csv (at least
   new_engine_ap_total + new_engine_warnings per fixture). DO NOT invent numbers — have the human
   confirm them against the PHB/guide first.
2. Rewrite testing/tests/engine-parity.html so each test ASSERTS total === expected and
   warnings.length === expected, setting pass from the comparison (not a literal).
3. CG-003: also assert remaining < 0 and the OVER BUDGET warning is present.
4. LS-001/EV-001: assert rebuildStateFromEvents(...).ok, total, eventsApplied.
```
**Done when:** perturbing one price in `DATA` makes the gate report a FAILED test; with no change it's 5/0
against the captured baseline. (Full detail: REV-01.)

## REV-02 — Service worker: cache same-origin only (HIGH) — TODO
The SW caches every 200 GET cache-first, including Supabase API reads → stale rosters/characters + other
users' data sitting in Cache Storage.
```
In service-worker.js fetch handler, bail out for anything not on our origin:
  const url = new URL(e.request.url);
  if (url.origin !== self.location.origin) return;   // never touch Supabase / esm.sh
Then apply the same-origin strategy (see REV-03).
```
**Done when:** Cache Storage holds only `/PACT/...` assets, never `*.supabase.co`; a cross-device edit
reads the server value, not a cached one. (Full detail: REV-02.)

## REV-03 — Service worker: network-first for app shell + engine (HIGH) — TODO
`js/engine.js` is served cache-first from a static `CACHE_NAME`, so a shipped rules fix never reaches
returning users until the SW's own bytes change.
```
Network-first (or stale-while-revalidate) for *.html + js/engine.js, falling back to cache offline;
cache-first only for content-addressed static assets (icons). Optionally derive CACHE_NAME from BUILD
so activate purges old caches each release. Log the choice in DECISIONS.md.
```
**Done when:** editing only `js/engine.js`, deploying, and reloading an installed PWA serves the NEW
engine without clearing storage; offline still loads. (Full detail: REV-03.)

## REV-04 — Close the campaign-join bypass in RLS (HIGH) — TODO
`campaign_id` is in the player update grant + the insert policy only checks ownership, so a player can set
`campaign_id` directly, skipping `join_campaign()`. *(Re-verify against the current D-GH7 RLS first — it
may have shifted.)*
```
Preferred: remove campaign_id from the player update grant; make join_campaign() (SECURITY DEFINER) the
sole writer of campaign_id; add a leave-campaign RPC if needed. Alt: constrain insert/update with
WITH CHECK (campaign_id is null or is_campaign_member(campaign_id)).
```
**Done when:** a manual insert/update setting `campaign_id` to an un-joined campaign is rejected;
`join_campaign(valid_code)` still works and still blocks double-joins. (Full detail: REV-04.)

## CU-1 — Single-source agent docs — TODO  *(closes review REV-08)*
Files provided — just commit: overwrite `AGENTS.md`; replace `CLAUDE.md` with the `@AGENTS.md` stub and
`.github/copilot-instructions.md` with the pointer stub; update `docs/HOW-TO-WORK.md` (drop the "three
identical copies" chore).
**Done when:** `git grep -l "Master copy"` is empty; `CLAUDE.md` is the stub.

## CU-2 — Commit VERSION-SYNC.md + confirm build versions match — TODO
Add `docs/VERSION-SYNC.md` (provided). Verify `BUILD` in `js/engine.js` equals the CharGen / Live Sheet /
DM Console labels (all `v0.107` now). `index.html` reads `BUILD` live — don't touch it.
**Done when:** `docs/VERSION-SYNC.md` committed; `BUILD` matches all three tools.

## CU-3 — Tidy root & test files — TODO  *(closes review REV-09)*
Delete `index.old.html` + `.tmp-verify.mjs`; move `campaign-test.html` + `sync-test.html` into `testing/`;
keep `login.html` + `docs/history/`; fix `testing/README.md` (it holds a stray repo description).
**Done when:** root is clean; harnesses open from `testing/`; `engine-parity.html` still 5/0.

## CU-4 — Prune merged branches — TODO  *(after promoting `preview → main`)*
Delete (merged into preview): `data/tools-v0.332`, `engine/data-v0.332`, `feature/dual-source-ap`,
`feature/live-sheet-dual-ap`, `fix/engine-v0.332-data`, `task1/pwa-shell`, `task2/auth`,
`task3/sql-data-model`, `feature/campaign-play`; on origin also `feature/homepage-index`. KEEP `main`,
`preview`, `task2/auth-gate`.
**Done when:** `git branch` shows only `main`, `preview`, `task2/auth-gate` (+ anything active).

## CU-5 — Fix duplicate `D-GH7` in DECISIONS.md — TODO
Two entries share `D-GH7`. Renumber the OLDER (PWA service-worker) one to `D-GH8`; leave campaign-play
`D-GH7` (referenced by `js/campaign.js` + `CHANGELOG.md`).
**Done when:** each `D-GH#` appears once; no reference orphaned.

## CU-6 — (optional) Rename `DM Console.html` → `DM-Console.html` — TODO
Drop the space; update index menu link, SW precache, and any other references.
**Done when:** nothing references "DM Console.html"; console opens + is precached; parity 5/0.

---

# 🟡 NEXT — medium-severity fixes + remaining build work

## REV-05 — Sync: compare parsed instants, not strings (MEDIUM) — TODO
`js/sync.js:125` does `local.updated_at > server.updated_at` — breaks across `Z` vs `+00:00` / differing
precision, causing lost updates.
```
const localNewer = local.dirty && Date.parse(local.updated_at) > Date.parse(server.updated_at);
```
**Done when:** mixed-format timestamps order correctly; add a unit test. (Full detail: REV-05.)

## REV-06 — Offline delete: tombstones so it stays deleted (MEDIUM) — TODO
Offline, `deleteCharacter` removes local but not server, so the row re-pulls on reconnect.
```
Maintain a pact-deletes tombstone list; syncAll/online handler replays delete().eq('id',…) then clears
it; listCharacters filters out tombstoned ids so they don't reappear.
```
**Done when:** delete offline → stays gone in UI; on reconnect server row is removed, never re-pulled.
(Full detail: REV-06.)

## REV-07 — Invite codes from a CSPRNG (MEDIUM) — TODO
`gen_invite_code` uses `floor(random()*36)` (non-CSPRNG), no throttling.
```
Build the code from gen_random_bytes(n) (pgcrypto already enabled) mapped onto the alphabet; consider 8
chars and/or rate-limiting join_campaign. Keep the check regex (update it if you lengthen).
```
**Done when:** codes still unique + match the check regex, sourced from `gen_random_bytes`.
(Full detail: REV-07.)

## Task 6 — CharGen module bridge migration — TODO
```
Migrate tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html from its embedded DATA + compute() copy to the shared
module bridge, matching Live Sheet and DM Console.
1. Add a <script type="module"> importing { DATA, compute, baseBuild, MUT, activeEvents, economy,
   foldBuild } from '../js/engine.js', copy each onto window, then dispatch new Event('engine-ready').
2. Gate the existing UI <script> on document.addEventListener('engine-ready', ...).
3. Delete the inline const DATA = {...} (line ~428) and function compute(b){...} entirely.
Compat note: CharGen's compute() differs only in the budget line; canonical compute(b,opts) defaults
opts={} → spendable === b.budget, identical behaviour. Extra return fields (playerAp/dmAp/spendable)
are ignored. No UI change.
```
**Done when:** CharGen loads + prices correctly, no embedded DATA/compute remains, parity still 5/0.
*(Then all three tools are on the bridge — architecture uniform. Best done AFTER REV-01 makes the gate real.)*
⚠️ **Interim risk:** the parity gate guards only `js/engine.js`, **not** CharGen's embedded copy — a future
engine change can silently diverge CharGen (they're identical today except the budget line; DATA synced at
v0.332). CharGen's header warns "mirror engine/DATA changes into BOTH files"; until this task lands,
**AUD-1** should assert the two stay in sync.

## Feature A — Live Sheet multi-tradition / multi-discipline spellcasting (+ Magically Bound) — TODO
Branch `feat/multi-tradition-discipline`. **Engine first** (extend `found`, add `dbound`), then the tools.
```
Allow buying >1 tradition and >1 discipline per tradition, each shown by name on its own row.
Per-discipline "Magically Bound" (one-way; reverse only by undo): Binding awards a flat +2 AP with NO
retroactive refund; the −1 spell discount (cantrips/slots/known, floor 1; not Foundation/Rank) applies
from then on. Move "Subclass spell lists" into the Magic category.
5 tasks across 2 files (parity stays 5/0 throughout). Execution order: 1 → verify parity → 4 → 5 → 3 → 2.
  1. js/engine.js (MUT) — extend `found` (add a discipline to an existing tradition) + add a `dbound`
     setter (sets d.bound on {ti,di}). Additive only, ZERO compute() change. VERIFY PARITY after task 1.
  2. Live Sheet — 'Spellcasting' GROUPS closure: iterate all traditions + disciplines, per-discipline
     headers, a Magically Bound toggle, and "Add discipline" / "Open another tradition" buttons.
  3. Live Sheet — priceOf: 3 lines so dbound/mbound flat-price ±2 AP (no full recompute). Also fixes a
     pre-existing Martially Bound refund bug.
  4. Live Sheet — _catOf: move 'Subclass spell lists' to Magic (2 lines).
  5. Live Sheet — ib() tooltip wiring (1 line) + pass a descr to Martially Bound's ib() call.
Full spec: IMPLEMENT-multi-tradition-discipline.md (+ ENGINE-CHANGES-prompt.md for the engine slice);
snippets are from a v0.322 standalone — read the live code and adapt. Read the Live Sheet HTML ONCE and
apply tasks 4,5,3,2 in a single editing pass (it's large).
```
**Done when:** multiple traditions/disciplines buy + display correctly; Magically Bound applies +2/−1 with
no retroactive refund; subclass lists sit under Magic; parity stays 5/0.
⚠️ Kit claims `compute()` / `DATA.version` are untouched — **verify that for a pricing feature**; if pricing
changes, update the REV-01 baseline and follow the version rule. Log under a **NEW** decision code
(**D-GH9** — the draft's "D-GH3" is already taken).

## Feature B — Save-file integrity (tamper-evidence) — TODO
Branch `feat/save-integrity`. **Do AFTER Feature A.** Engine first (sign/verify helpers), then the tools.
```
Sign each save; Live Sheet flags edited/corrupted files on load (non-blocking); DM Console badges them;
CharGen exports signed too. Tamper-EVIDENT, not tamper-proof (client-side) — the offline stopgap before
the Supabase enforcement phase. Engine: sign/verify helpers. Tools: Live Sheet save/load flag, DM Console
badge, CharGen sign. Full spec: IMPLEMENT-save-integrity.md (+ ENGINE-INTEGRITY-prompt.md).
```
**Done when:** a signed save verifies clean; a hand-edited save is flagged on load (without blocking) and
badged in DM Console; CharGen exports are signed; parity stays 5/0.
⚠️ Log under a **NEW** decision code (**D-GH10** — the draft's "D-GH4" is taken). Touches CharGen —
coordinate with **Task 6** so the two CharGen edits don't collide.

## AUD-1 — Automated health check (static audit + RLS proof) — TODO
The repeatable "is the system still healthy?" check you asked for — a stdlib Python script, no installs,
runs in seconds.
```
testing/scripts/audit.py (Python stdlib only) — file-based checks, run before every commit:
- every service-worker PRE_CACHE URL exists on disk; icons 192/512/180 present; 404.html exists
- manifest has required fields, scope + start_url = /PACT/, and a maskable icon
- SW registration present in every HTML page; no unconditional skipWaiting() in the install handler
- flag any asset > 100 KB
- CharGen's embedded DATA/compute still matches js/engine.js (until Task 6 removes the copy)
Optional RLS proof (Python + requests, credentials entered at runtime — never commit them): as a non-DM
player, confirm BOTH writes are REJECTED via the Supabase REST API — (a) writing characters.ap (the DM-only
column lock) and (b) setting campaign_id to a campaign never joined (proves REV-04 is closed).
```
**Done when:** runs clean on a healthy tree and fails loudly on a planted break (a missing PRE_CACHE file,
or a player REST write to `ap` that succeeds). Pairs with REV-01/REV-11 — engine-parity joins CI once
REV-01 makes the gate assert.

# ⚪ LATER — low-severity fixes + ideas (not scheduled)

**Low-severity review findings:**
- **REV-10** — `.claude/` is tracked despite `.gitignore`. Fix: `git rm --cached -r .claude` (keep on disk), commit.
- **REV-11** — No CI. Add a headless Node runner that imports `js/engine.js`, runs the fixtures, and asserts
  against `expected-results.csv` (pairs with REV-01); wire as a GitHub Action on PRs. No npm *runtime* deps.
- **REV-12** — Make "every player-controlled value passes through `esc()`" a hard invariant; add a line to
  `AGENTS.md` Hard rules. Rises in importance once cloud data crosses users.
- **REV-13** — Dead grant maps `grantSk/grantTl/grantIn` in `engine.js` (~:62) are never populated. Wire up
  or remove; don't change pricing without updating the REV-01 baseline in the same PR.
- **REV-14** — (optional, engine-targeted) Extract `DATA` into `engine-data.json`; split `compute()` into
  named sub-pricers. Only safe once REV-01 gives real assertions; dedicated PR, byte-identical output.

**Polish & hardening** (from the Task 5 audit session):
- **Real icons** — replace the placeholder 192/512/180 PNGs with real artwork (needs your art).
- **Pin/bundle supabase-js** — it's `@supabase/supabase-js@2` (major-pinned only); pin the exact version
  (or vendor a local copy) so a CDN minor update can't change offline behaviour.

**Landing-page follow-ups** (deferred from the redesign):
- Extend theming to the guide and tools (index-only today).
- "Continue / recent characters" on the landing page (needs the tools' save format).
- iOS "Add to Home Screen" hint (no `beforeinstallprompt` on iOS Safari).

**Supporting reference tasks** (run when needed):
- Supabase project setup · Icon & asset list (192/512/180) · Offline UX spec · Future-features roadmap.

**Improvements** (recommended action first; the *then* line is a lower-priority upgrade with its caveat):
- **A1 — Engine API contract.** Add a JSDoc block atop `js/engine.js` (signatures + one line per export) so
  agents grasp the API without reading 238 KB. *Then (optional):* a dev-only `engine.d.ts` for IDE
  autocomplete — *caveat:* a new format to maintain; can read as "TypeScript creeping in."
- **A2 — PR template.** Add `.github/pull_request_template.md` with the per-change checklist so every PR
  auto-includes it. *Then (optional):* a fuller `CONTRIBUTING.md` if you onboard more people — *caveat:* it
  isn't auto-inserted, so it's easy to skip.
- **A3 — Client error visibility.** Add a global `onerror`/`unhandledrejection` handler logging to the
  console + a "Report issue" link in the footer. *Then (lower priority):* log errors to a Supabase table
  once sign-in is the default — *caveats:* extra write traffic + a privacy note to document.
- **A4 — DECISIONS.md index.** Add a one-line-per-decision index at the top + the rule "next code =
  highest + 1" (and fix the dup via CU-5). *Then (lower priority):* auto-generate the index — *caveat:*
  depends on AUD-1 existing.
- **A5 — Bulk "back up all characters."** Add a "Back up all" button → one JSON bundle, plus restore, so a
  localStorage user can't lose everything to a browser clear. *Then:* the Supabase migration supersedes it
  — *caveat:* keep the local backup until cloud sign-in is the default.
- **A6 — Tag releases to the build version.** `git tag v0.x` (matching `BUILD`) + a GitHub Release per
  ship, for a labelled rollback point. *Then (lighter alternative):* tags only, no notes — *caveat:* less
  context on what each release shipped.
- **A7 — Lighthouse 85 → 90.** Add a Lighthouse CI GitHub Action to auto-catch perf regressions. *Then
  (lower priority, higher risk):* split/lazy-load the engine (= REV-14) for the real score gain —
  *caveats:* a big engine change; do it only after REV-01 makes the gate real.
- **A8 — AI working defaults.** Add a short "working efficiently" note to `docs/HOW-TO-WORK.md`: Sonnet +
  default effort for spec-driven execution (Opus only for ambiguous/architectural), one task per fresh
  session, read big files once.

---

# Conventions
- One task per branch/commit; re-open `engine-parity.html` after each.
- Keep `js/engine.js` off-limits unless a task targets it.
- When a task here is done, move it to `CHANGELOG.md` — don't leave DONE items here.
