# PACT — PWA Build Plan

> Written for agentic assistants (VS Code Copilot & Claude Code). With `AGENTS.md` committed, you don't
> repeat project context — **paste one task at a time**, review the diff, accept. Each task ends with a
> **Done when** check. (Markdown copy of `RPG-PWA-Build-Plan.html` v5, kept in-repo so the prompts are at hand.)

## Already built
- Rules centralised into `js/engine.js` (single source of truth) — **DONE**
- Live Sheet + DM Console refactored to UI-only via the module bridge — **DONE** (CharGen still has an embedded copy — see Task 6)
- Deployed to GitHub Pages from the repo root (chompy78.github.io/PACT/) — **DONE**
- Regression pack `testing/tests/engine-parity.html` → 5/5 — **DONE**

## Task 0 — Land PHB pages + drawback text (data only) — TODO
See `ENGINE-DATA-UPDATE.md`. Surgical `DATA` edit; `compute()` and `DATA.version` unchanged.
**Done when:** parity still 5/5; tooltips show "(PHB p.N)" and the fuller drawback text.

## Task 1 — PWA shell (offline + installable) — TODO
```
Make the site an installable, offline-capable PWA. Add:
- manifest.json (name, short_name, icons 192 + 512, theme/background colours,
  display: standalone, start_url and scope both "/PACT/").
- service-worker.js with a versioned CACHE_NAME that pre-caches: index.html, js/engine.js,
  every file in tools/, docs/PACT-Players-Guide.html, manifest.json, and the icons.
  Cache-first, network fallback.
- A registration snippet (navigator.serviceWorker.register) in index.html and each tool page.
- 404.html that redirects to index.html (GitHub Pages routing).
- Detect a waiting service worker and offer a non-disruptive "reload to update".
Do not change the engine or the tools' UI. Add icons/ (192, 512, apple-touch 180) as
placeholders if none exist and list what I must replace.
```
**Done when:** the browser's "installable" check passes, the site loads with no network after one visit,
and `engine-parity.html` is still 5/5.

## Task 2 — Supabase client + login — TODO
```
Add authentication with Supabase Auth.
- js/supabase-client.js: a single Supabase client instance (URL + anon key as constants I'll fill in).
- js/auth.js: email/password register + login, forgot-password (Supabase reset email), logout,
  session in localStorage.
- Include auth.js on index.html and each tool page. On load, check the session; if not signed in,
  show a plain-HTML login/register view. After login, read the user's role and route:
  Player -> tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html, DM -> tools/DM Console.html.
Vanilla JS, plain HTML only. Don't break the existing tools.
```
**Done when:** a new user can register, log in, gets routed by role, and logout returns to the login view.

## Task 3 — Cloud save & offline sync — TODO
```
Add cloud save + sync in js/sync.js.
- Save character data to Supabase (primary) and localStorage (offline fallback).
- Sync on the window "online" event and on app load when signed in + online.
- Conflict resolution: last-write-wins by updated_at; push local only if newer.
- Store ONLY raw character data in characters.stats (CharGen = build JSON; Live Sheet =
  the { LOG, SEQ, rules } event log). Never store derived stats; hydrate from stats and recompute.
- ap (the DM-awarded points column) is ALWAYS server-authoritative: never overwrite it from localStorage.
- On a failed write, keep local and retry on the next online event; never delete local until a
  server write is confirmed.
Also output sql/schema.sql and sql/rls-policies.sql for the data model.
```
**Done when:** edits persist to Supabase, survive going offline, reconcile on reconnect — `ap` never changed by a local push.

## Task 4 — Campaigns & DM AP — TODO
```
Add the campaign + DM system.
- Campaigns: one DM, no player cap; roles are PER-CAMPAIGN and may overlap (the same user can DM one
  campaign and play in another, or even play in their own). Join via a 6-char alphanumeric invite code;
  DM can regenerate the code (invalidating the old one). (See DECISIONS.md D-GH4 — this overrides the
  original "up to 5 players / joining a full campaign errors" wording.)
- The SQL backend already exists (sql/schema.sql, sql/rls-policies.sql, Task 3): joining goes through the
  join_campaign() RPC, code regen through regenerate_invite_code(), and ap is awarded via award_ap()
  (DM-only). Wire js/campaign.js / js/dm.js to those RPCs rather than writing the rows directly.
- Enforce access in Supabase RLS (not just client JS): players read/write only their own character and
  can NEVER write ap; only the campaign's DM can write ap or campaign rows. ap is locked at the COLUMN
  level (a GRANT that omits ap) plus the DM-only award_ap() RPC — not a row policy, since Postgres RLS
  cannot restrict an UPDATE to specific columns.
- Evolve tools/DM Console.html: read the campaign roster from Supabase (player name, character name,
  current AP), expand a character to read-only full stats via the engine, add an "Award AP" input that
  writes ap (DM-only).
Put join/invite logic in js/campaign.js and DM logic in js/dm.js.
```
**Done when:** a DM can award AP; a player cannot change `ap` via the UI, a local sync, or a direct REST call with their token.

## Task 5 — Audit, security & hardening — TODO
```
Audit the finished app. For each item give Pass/Fail/Warning + a fix: PWA (manifest, SW, HTTPS,
icons 192/512/180); Offline (full load no network, local save offline, sync on reconnect); RLS characters
(own-only; cannot write ap even via REST with a valid token); RLS campaigns (own campaign read; DM-only
writes; invite regen DM-only); AP integrity (DM award; player cannot overwrite via dev tools/local sync/API);
GitHub Pages (no server logic, 404.html, SW scope "/PACT/"); Security (anon key safe under RLS?, RLS bypass
via REST, invite-code brute forcing, session token in localStorage/XSS); Performance (Lighthouse mobile >= 90,
flag assets > 100KB); Regression (engine-parity 5/5).
```
**Done when:** every item is Pass (or an accepted Warning) and parity still passes.

## Supporting reference tasks (run when needed)
- **Supabase project setup** — step-by-step: create project, run `schema.sql`, apply `rls-policies.sql`,
  enable email/password auth, set reset redirect to `https://chompy78.github.io/PACT/`, store URL + anon key.
- **Icon & asset list** — exact sizes (192, 512, 180), PNG, where referenced, iOS specifics. List only.
- **Offline UX spec** — a state table (State | indicator | can do | cannot do | automatic).
- **Future features roadmap** — 5 features that fit this architecture with no server/data-model change.

## Task 6 — CharGen module bridge migration — TODO

```
Migrate tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html from its embedded DATA + compute() copy to the shared
module bridge, matching the pattern already used by Live Sheet and DM Console.

Steps:
1. Add a <script type="module"> that imports
     { DATA, compute, baseBuild, MUT, activeEvents, economy, foldBuild }
   from '../js/engine.js', copies each onto window, then dispatches
     document.dispatchEvent(new Event('engine-ready'))
2. Gate the existing UI <script> block on that event:
     document.addEventListener('engine-ready', function() { ... })
   If the UI code is split across multiple <script> tags, gate each one or hoist them
   into a single DOMContentLoaded + engine-ready listener.
3. Delete the inline const DATA = {...} JSON blob (line ~428) and function compute(b){...}
   entirely — they are the only things to remove.

Key compatibility note: CharGen's embedded compute() differs from engine.js only in the
budget line (CharGen: `const budget=b.budget||0; const remaining=budget-total`).
The canonical compute(b, opts) defaults opts to {}, giving dmAp=0 and ignorePlayerAp=false,
so spendable === b.budget — identical behaviour. CharGen never passes opts, so no UI change.
The return object gains extra fields (playerAp, dmAp, spendable) that CharGen ignores.

Do not change any UI behaviour, sections, or styling.
```
**Done when:** CharGen loads, prices a build correctly, no embedded DATA or compute() remains
in the HTML file, and `testing/tests/engine-parity.html` still reports 5/5.

## Other improvements
- Commit the instructions file (`AGENTS.md` + copies) first.
- One task per branch/commit; re-open `engine-parity.html` after each.
- Keep `js/engine.js` off-limits unless a task targets it.
- Eventually rename `DM Console.html` → `DM-Console.html` (cleaner URLs); update the menu link.
